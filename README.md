Knobs
==========

Knobs is one of several demo iOS apps for the [Philadelphia Game Lab](philadelphiagamelab.org)'s [Sonic library](github.com/philadelphiagamelab/Sonic). As with all Sonic apps, Knobs requires headphones.

This is a fork of [SteerAudio](github.com/philadelphiagamelab/SteerAudio), but rather than use gyroscope input to affect sound, with Knobs the user can move an audio object around by turning two knobs: one for the object's [azimuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth) and a second for the object's [pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)), both in relation to the user. A third knob may eventually be added to adjust the distance of the audio object from the user, but for now the audio object is fixed on the unit sphere surrounding the user's head. As the user adjust these knobs, the sound changes as if they were actually moving the audio source around their head.
